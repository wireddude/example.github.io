# The Day

Today we went shopping and then went to a birthday party. It was really fun. It was a Star Wars birthday party. The kids got louder and louder and volume went up and up as the party went on.

Also, in my spare time, I spent some time setting up an instance of [rocket.chat](http://rocket.chat) on my raspberry pi 2. That was pretty cool. My current server can be accessed [here](https://e1387663.ngrok.io)
